# dancing-sliders
This is a weird one...

Uses [React.createFactory](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/10/14/introducing-react-elements.html) to spawn numerous heavily styled [HTML5 input range sliders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) that modify themselves in parallel: greatly varying in number and in the process repositioning along a grid-like pattern with a slightly randomized offset, appearing as if to dance down the screen like bytecode in an ansi terminal.

**[Alternative diagonal version](http://sretaeper.ucoz.com/dancing-sliders/index_diagonal.html)**

*This is one in a series of experiments in using functional transformations to manipulate markup and other traditionally design based GUI elements to create decontextualized user experiences.*
